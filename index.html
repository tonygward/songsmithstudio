        <p>Looking for an affordable recording studio in Manchester?</p>        

        <h2>We can help</h2>
        <p>I am an independent home studio with 20 years experience recording all genres of music.</p>
        
        <p>Being a songwriter and musician myself, I know how much it means to record music and want to share my experience with others.</p>        

        <p>As a qualified I.T. specialist, I can also create websites and even get you on <strong>iTunes</strong> and other music services.</p>
